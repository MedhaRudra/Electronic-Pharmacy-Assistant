# Electronic-Pharmacy-Assistant

Hopping from store to store, looking for prescribed medicines is not the ideal activity any patient or their caretakers would want to go through. It is tedious and draining. We propose a project idea that aims to resolve this problem and makes people’s lives easier, in an efficient way.

The goal of our project is to provide a distributed and scalable service that eases the process of buying necessary medicines so that consumers don’t have to make several trips to different stores to check the availability of medicines. A patient would upload their prescription and we would extract its contents using an OCR API in the form of a list of prescribed medicines. Subsequently, we would search our Database that contains the inventory details of Pharmacies and return the availability of the required medicines along with the details of the minimum number of pharmacies that the patient needs to visit to get all the medicines.

An extended goal, if time permits, would be to optimize our algorithm based on the pharmacies nearest to the consumer.
